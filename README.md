# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data to understand academic trends,
study habits, and identify students who may require additional academic support.
The analysis is performed using Python and Pandas.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall student performance
- Compare previous scores with final scores to measure improvement
- Study the relationship between study time and performance
- Identify top-performing and struggling students
- Categorize students into pass and fail groups
- Highlight students with high effort but low performance

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes student academic and behavioral information such as:
- Final scores
- Previous scores
- Subject-wise previous performance
- Daily study hours
- Attendance percentage
- Pass/Fail status

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Improvement score calculation
- Statistical summary using `describe()`
- Correlation analysis between study time and performance
- Ranking students using multiple criteria
- Identification of high-effort, low-performance students
- Data visualization using scatter plots

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Student performance varies significantly across the dataset.
- Study time shows a moderate positive relationship with improvement and final scores.
- Some students invest high study effort but still score low, indicating the need for personalized academic support.
- Academic performance is influenced by multiple factors beyond study hours alone.
